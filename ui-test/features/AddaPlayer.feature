Feature:  Add a Player
To be able to contact our players, as a coach Iâ€™d like to add player names and address details into the system

Background:

	Given we have a team called Western Knights 1st Team for the season 2014 with no players listed
	
Scenario: The player vital details need to be entered

	Given I have an empty Player List
	when I enter vital details [firstname], [surname], [dob], [address], [suburb], [postcode], [phone], [email]
	then The player list should have 1 player listed

Where:
	 firstname	| surname	| dob			| address										| suburb		| postcode		| phone			| email						|
	 Mile		| Jedinak	| 3 Aug 1984	| Selhurst Park Stadium Whitehorse Lane 		| London 		| SE25 6PU		| 0432299934	| mile@crystalpalace.org	|
